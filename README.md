# Student Career Prediction using DecisionTreeClassifier

Welcome to the Student Career Prediction project repository! This supervised learning model, developed in a Jupyter Notebook, utilizes the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm from SKLearn to predict students' future careers or professions based on various features such as age, gender, grades, etc. The project involves data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and the creation of a predictive model.

## Model Overview

### Data Collection and Cleaning

- **Dataset Source:**
  - The student data used for training and testing the model was collected from [provide_dataset_source_link].
  - The dataset underwent cleaning procedures using pandas to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Preprocessing steps involved transforming the data to ensure it is suitable for training the model.
  - Features like grades and other non-numeric data were processed for better model compatibility.

- **One-Hot Encoding:**
  - Non-numeric categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numeric values.

### Model Creation and Training

- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - The DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm from SKLearn was chosen for its suitability in classification tasks and interpretability.

- **Training Process:**
  - The model was trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships between input features and the target variable (career).

### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy Metrics:**
  - Model performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics to measure its effectiveness in predicting student careers.

- **Visualization:**
  - Utilized matplotlib for visualizing the decision tree structure for interpretability.

## Project Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`student_career_prediction.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Make Predictions:**
   - Input student information to make predictions about their potential future careers.

## Note

This Student Career Prediction project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques for predicting student careers based on various attributes. Utilizing the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm, the model offers interpretability and insights into the decision-making process.
